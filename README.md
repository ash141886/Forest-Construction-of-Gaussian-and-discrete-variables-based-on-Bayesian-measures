# Forest-Construction-based on WBIC

## Forest construction of Gaussian and discrete variables based on WBIC and Copula density estimation
In computing mutual information (MI) for a combination of discrete and continuous variables, a significant challenge arises due to the inherent complexity in determining the joint density of such mixed variables. Previous methodologies have tackled this issue by making substantial assumptions about the directionality of the variables. Notably, Edwards (2010) attempted to calculate MI for mixed variables by segregating the discrete variables from the continuous ones, albeit this approach introduced a noteworthy limitation.

Our proposed method, on the other hand, effectively addresses this limitation, offering a more robust solution. Furthermore, our approach handles other constraints related to sample sizes, thus demonstrating its versatility and superiority in the computation of MI for mixed-variable scenarios.
