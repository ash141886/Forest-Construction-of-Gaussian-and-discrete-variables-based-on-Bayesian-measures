# Forest-Construction-based on WBIC

## Forest construction of Gaussian and discrete variables based on WBIC and Copula density estimation
The problem is obtaining the mutual information for the mixture of discrete and continuous variables because it is not straightforward to get the joint density of the mixed variables.ã€€Some previous methods obtained the MI for mixed variables with a strong assumption of the direction of variables. Edwards, 2010 tried to obtain the MI for a mixture separating the discrete variables from the other, which is the major limitation of the method. Our method successfully overcame that issue, with other limitations faced for sample sizes.
